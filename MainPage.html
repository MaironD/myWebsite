    <p>This website is intended to follow my journey and show my progress from changing career. Going from an exercise science and physical education background to a Full-Stack developer. My decision to change started earlier this year in April, with the help of an old friend. I took a crash course in Java and dedicated 1 hour a day for the next 4 months. In this learning frenzy, I was retaining the knowledge but still felt like I knew nothing. For instance if you were to place me infront of a computer and told me to write you a Java application, I would have no idea where to start. But if you gave me a test with the Java basics, I would pass it. Feeling a bit bent-out-of-shape, I started to experiment with other coding languages. Since I had a background in photoshop and making websites from back in the day, I found front-end , HTML, CSS, JavaScript and here I am. Stay tuned for more... </p>

    <p>A long story short...</p>
    <p>My goal is to learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery and more tools that would aid in making some sweet websites. I'm also reading on UX/UI and watching tons of Bob Ross to better my design ideas.</p>
